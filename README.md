Group Name: 4444-Chat_Group-5

About
-----
Ventilate is a cross platfrom peer-to-peer distributed chat application built on the Qt5 platform. Ventilate version 1 is not privacy based due to time constraints of being a semester project, but the distributed nature of the program allows us to easily add chat encryption and other user privacy features easily when we have more time.
