Things to do: (feel free to revise and enhance)
    * Get server up and running
    	-> Store list of connected peers
    	-> Add peer to the list when it connects
    	-> Remove peer from list when it disconnects
    * Get client connected to server
    	-> Generate RSA keys for each client
    	-> Send public key to directly connected peers (Not every client needs every public key, peers only need public keys of clients they're directly connected to)
    	-> Rebalance network when a peer disconnects
    * Get GUI connected
    * Test and smash bugs
