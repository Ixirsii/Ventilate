Our Deliverable II report is located at:
	./Documents/Project_Reports/2/Deliverable_II.pdf
which is what should be used for grading.

This document contains our complete report for Deliverable II.
A table of contents at the begining.of this report shows where to find specific elements, like the UML diagrams and our updated planning.

Our UML diagrams are located at:
	Documents/Planning_Documents/UML_Diagrams-Deliverable_II/
and consist of the three files:
	class_diagram-combined.png
	sequence_diagram-combined.png
	use_case_diagram-combined.png
though they are included in full in our Deliverable II report.
